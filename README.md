# PyWell
A collection of independent Python scripts following the Unix philosphy of doing one thing well. Each script is a single function that can be called in mulitple contexts, e.g. directly as a function, via comand line prompt, via AWS lambda invocation, etc. The functions are intended to be easily composable to build more complex applications.
